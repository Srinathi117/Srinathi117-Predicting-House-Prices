# House Price Prediction using Simple Linear Regression

## Overview

The goal of this project is to build a simple linear regression model to predict house prices based on features such as the number of bedrooms and square footage. The project uses a dataset containing historical house prices along with these features to predict future prices. This project aims to help you understand the basics of regression modeling and prediction.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about various houses, including features like the number of bedrooms, square footage, and corresponding house prices. The target variable is the price of the house, which we aim to predict using the other features.

## Requirements

- Python
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
